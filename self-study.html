                <h3>Self-Study</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to my formal education, I am deeply committed to self-study in the field of cybersecurity.<br>
                    I believe that continuous learning is essential in this rapidly evolving industry, and I actively seek out resources and opportunities to expand my knowledge.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My self-study efforts include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completing modules and rooms in HackTheBox and TryHackMe</li>
                    <li>Participating in SWIFT competitions and online competitions like Hivestorm</li>
                    <li>Practicing defense strategies in my own virtual machines</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Through these activities, I aim to stay current with the latest trends, tools, and techniques in cybersecurity, enhancing my skills and preparing myself for a successful career in the field.

                <p>
                    In addition to online platforms and competitions, I also practice defense strategies in my own virtual machine environments.<br>
                    By setting up and configuring virtual machines, I can simulate real-world scenarios and test various security measures to protect against potential threats.<br>
                    This hands-on approach allows me to experiment with different tools and techniques, gaining practical experience in securing systems and networks.
