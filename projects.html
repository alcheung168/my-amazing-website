                <p>
                    To further expand my knowledge and gain real-world hands-on experience, I have undertaken several projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in practical scenarios.<br>
                    These projects, although not directly related to cybersecurity, have provided me with valuable insights into various aspects of machine learning and lab environments.

                <summary>IoT Device Fingerprinting Research (June 2025 - Present)</summary>
                <p>
                    Under Dr.Amamra, who personally invited me to join his project, I researched using Machine Learning classifiers to identify IoT devices based on network traffic.<br>
                    This research involded:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing Python programs with libraries such as PyTorch, numpy, and TensorFlow</li>
                    <li>Visualizing results and analyzing datasets</li>
                    <li>Submitting our research to the NDSS Symposium</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    See our submitted <a href="https://ndss26-fall.hotcrp.com/paper/1953?cap=hcav1953AAnRbiQXsdrdShBPEqShBTeB" target="_blank">paper</a> for more information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, our goal is to continue research using neural operators to improve accuracy and efficiency.<br>
                    We aim to submit this research to a top-tier conference hosted by IEEE in November.

                <summary>NSF Cybersecurity Lab Development Project (September 2025 - Present)</summary>
                <p>
                    As of recently, I joined a micro-internship to develop lab assignments for CIS courses relating to cybersecurity.<br>
                    Although I have only started recently, I am excited to contribute to this project and help create engaging and informative lab assignments for students.
